### Hardware Requirements

- CUDA-ready GPU with Compute Capability 7.0+
- 24 GB VRAM (to train to paper evaluation quality)

### Software Requirements
- Conda (recommended for easy setup)
- CUDA SDK 11 for PyTorch extensions, install *after* Visual Studio (we used 11.8, **known issues with 11.6**)

#### Local Setup

Our default, provided install method is based on Conda package and environment management:
```shell
SET DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1 # Windows only
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate gaussian_splatting
```
Please note that this process assumes that you have CUDA SDK **11** installed, not **12**. For modifications, see below.

Tip: Downloading packages and creating a new environment with Conda can require a significant amount of disk space. By default, Conda will use the main system hard drive. You can avoid this by specifying a different package download location and an environment on a different drive:

```shell
conda config --add pkgs_dirs <Drive>/<pkg_path>
conda env create --file environment.yml --prefix <Drive>/<env_path>/gaussian_splatting
conda activate <Drive>/<env_path>/gaussian_splatting
```
